'''
1st:
I'd like to write a virtual reality boxing game, in which a player feels
just like sparring in real world.

2nd:
I'd like to explore data sets for image recognition AI,
When the model is in the best form,
it can detect what punch is thrown by a boxer...

3rd:
I'd like to develop a web application that can do data visualization,
for example, it can display CC certification details,
which is the project I'm working on...
