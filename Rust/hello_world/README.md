```

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have Rust installed. If not, follow the installation instructions in the previous message.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository or create a new Rust project using `cargo new hello_world`.
2. Navigate to the `hello_world` directory.
3. Open the `src/main.rs` file in a text editor.

## Code

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, World!");
}
```

### Build and Run
1. Compile the program:
`
cargo build
`
2. Run the compiled program:
`
cargo run
